					<h3>Can Site Layout Affect E-Commerce?</h3>
					<p>Breaking into the bridal industry is hard, but Anna King was no quiter. This startup, e-commerce site needed to make waves, sell products, and look good while doing it. They brought us on broad to design the landing page for their site, a page they would base the look and feel of the rest their site. They needed conversion and a luxurious feel. Challenge accepted.</p>
					<p>To look luxurious, we optimized the page's white space: think of walking into an Apple store vs. a resale shop. Space communicated value -more space, more value. We used this tactic with the testimonials and social hype sections. To easily convert, we funneled the layout to one end: purchase a product. Using this singular intent helped to unify the action requested from the user and increased the conversions in our user tests.</p>
                    <p>The final design we produced was everything the Anna King team had hoped. It was simple and aesthetically pleasing, providing the platform for the rest of their site.</p>
