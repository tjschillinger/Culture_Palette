					<h3>Small Business Sites Don't Have to be Complicated</h3>
					<p>The owners of Turf Smurfs, a local lawn care company, came to us after having a bad experience with another agency. All they wanted was a simple site that would allow them to have a web presence, and they didn’t want to be sold on more than that. “No BS, can you create a minimal site for us?” They asked.</p>
					<p>“Yes!” We replied. We talked with the owners in depth about their vision for the site, the layout, and basic content for the site. We conducted research ahead of time to ensure the site was competitive and used user stories to ensure it met their customer's goals as well.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the owners were exceedingly pleased with the results. Many users converted from visiting their website to using their services.</p>
