					<h3>Easy Icon Creator</h3>
					<p>A security application company approached us to design an icon creator that their clients could use with ease. The ceator needed to allow the client to change the background color of the icon, while allowing them to chose an icon from a pre-set library or upload a company logo. They also wanted us to couple this functionality with an eye-pleasing aesthetic.</p>
					<p>We decided to design two versions of the flow. We spent time developing the mockups and prototyping so that our test groups could provide feedback. From this A/B testing, we decided to present the design most popular with our users. For good messure, we also added a feature to allow a long shadow to be applied for a flat-design for the icon.</p>
                    <p>Simple, good looking, and functional, all this meet what Global Solutions needed. Their clients were happy, which made Global Solutions a happy client of ours.</p>
