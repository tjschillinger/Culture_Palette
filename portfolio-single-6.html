					<h3>A Photography Site Clients Want to Use</h3>
					<p>Marina, a mother of two toddlers and a mortgage, came to us because she needed a web presence for her photography business. She was unsatisfied with word-of-mouth marketing that was giving a new client every few months. While on a budget, her site needed to feature a gallery, an about section, package information, and a way to contact her.</p>
					<p>We first defined where all the features could live on her site. Working with her, we decided to make her site 3 pages, with the landing page pulling most of the weight. It told a story of what she did, who she was, and how to contact her. The rest of the site was devoted to different packages and their details.</p>
                    <p>We presented the developed product, and Marina was thrilled with the results. She tells us that people contact her weekly because of the site.</p>
