					<h3>File Sharing Across Multiple Platforms Made Easy</h3>
					<p>Sharing files in the office has become increasingly difficult as more and more devices and mediums hit the market. CollaborMate, a startup, wanted to address these issues while making collaboration in the office more streamlined. They needed us to design how their site would look and feel as their users would upload and peruse their files.</p>
					<p>We started by researching which files users wanted to store, and developed user stories from there. User flows then determined what information needed to display on which pages, making it easier to design wireframes and mockups in which to prototype. The final step included applying user feedback that we gathered from our test groups.</p>
                    <p>This project really made us flex in all areas of UX/UI design, and the results spoke for themselves. The team at CollaborMate couldn't believe how well our designs made their intentions a reality.</p>
