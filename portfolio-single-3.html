					<h3>What Do Users Want in a Calendar?</h3>
					<p>Social planning can be a chore. Schedule Peek wanted to turn this chore into an entertaining mobile and web application. For our part, they needed us to produce a calendar with minimal features (while preserving the essential ones) that was also aesthetically pleasing. As for functionality, this calendar needed to show planned events and event invites.</p>
					<p>We starting researching. Discovering what users considered essential vs. nice-to-haves helped us to determine which features needed to be front-and-center and the ones that could be tucked away -being easily accessible, but hidden. Using this research, we began iterative designing to understand where the information should live and how it should look. Because calendars can quickly become overbearing with different types of information competing for attention, we used subtle, but effective, techniques to show information hierarchy -namely font-settings and alternating background opacities for rows.</p>
                    <p>With the final iterations complete and the Schedule Peek team happy, they celebrated by scheduling a product-launch party.</p>
