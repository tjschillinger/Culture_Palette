					<h3>Developing a Music App with Heart</h3>
					<p>Everyone listens to music, but not all on the same medium. This fact provided an oppertunity for a start up named heartbeatz, a group that wanted to mix passion and music. They came to us needing code that could store and pull music on demand, without clunky load times</p>
					<p>Our team developed a site that heavily relied upon JS and a CMS. This project went through many sessions of refactoring and testing to cut back on load times and to make the experience as smooth as possible.</p>
                    <p>While heartbeatz handled the design and branding, we gave them the engine under the hood to make their machine functional. We gave them the beat to their heart, and we went on to present to investors with pride.</p>
